# Man on box

Yet another portfolio website. This is a simple static site/blog deployed to Github pages, but I wanted to experiment a little.

## Motivation

I absolutely love [Astro](https://astro.build/), it is my go to tool when building static sites. I also love [Go](https://go.dev/) and want to continue learning in this space. I wanted to see how far I could get by just using the standard library to build my own static site generator, and turns out, you can go pretty far.
